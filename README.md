Healthcare Analysis in Power BI

The Healthcare Analysis project leverages Power BI to provide deep insights into patient care, hospital operations, and overall healthcare quality metrics. Through interactive visualizations, this project examines key metrics like patient admission rates, length of stay, readmission rates, and patient demographics. The dashboard also tracks staff efficiency, bed occupancy rates, and resource utilization, allowing healthcare providers to identify bottlenecks and optimize operations. Additionally, insights into disease trends, treatment outcomes, and patient satisfaction scores support data-driven decision-making. This analysis ultimately aims to enhance healthcare quality, improve patient outcomes, and streamline operational efficiencies.
